# Emotion Recognition with FER2013

This project uses deep learning and computer vision to recognize human emotions in real time from facial expressions using the [FER2013](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013) dataset.

## Project Overview

- Built and trained a custom CNN model for emotion classification (7 classes)
- Dataset: FER2013 (grayscale 48x48 facial images)
- Real-time detection using webcam and OpenCV
- Face detection via Haar cascades
- Final model achieves ~50â€“53% accuracy on validation data

## Notebooks

- `data_loading_and_exploration.ipynb`: Class distribution, image samples, and average face visualization
- `model_training.ipynb`: CNN model training with Keras, plotted training/validation curves
- `real_time_detection.ipynb`: Live webcam demo with face detection and emotion classification

## Requirements

```bash
pip install opencv-python tensorflow matplotlib


## How to Run

Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/tshehadey/emotion-recognition-cv.git
cd emotion-recognition-cv

Run the real-time detection notebook:

Open the file named: real_time_detection.ipynb
Make sure the file: final_emotion_model.keras is in the same folder

Note: When you run the notebook, the webcam window may not pop up automatically.
You might have to click the OpenCV program icon on the bottom taskbar to bring it to the front.

Press the "q" key to exit the webcam loop.
